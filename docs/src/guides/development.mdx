## Set Up

Clone repository, install dependencies, and run the dev script to start the docs and playroom sites.

```bash
yarn add @ensdomains/thorin
yarn
yarn dev
```

## Component Groups

Thorin is organized according to the [`Atomic Design Methodology`](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/).

**Atoms** serve as the foundational building blocks that comprise all our user interfaces. These atoms include basic HTML elements like form labels, inputs, buttons, and others that canâ€™t be broken down any further without ceasing to be functional.

**Molecules** are relatively simple groups of UI elements functioning together as a unit. For example, a form label, search input, and button can join together to create a search form molecule.

**Organisms** are relatively complex UI components composed of groups of molecules and/or atoms and/or other organisms. These organisms form distinct sections of an interface.

## Adding Components

Adding a component requires adding and modifying several files. The different steps to adding a component are:

### 1. Create a component file

The react component file should be named in pascal case and placed in a folder with the same name in the directory of the component group.

### 2. Create a component test file

The react component test file should have the same name as the component file with a file extension of .test.tsx. It should be located in the same directory as the component file.

### 3.Create a component index file

The react component and type should be exported in an index file in the same directory as the component file. If a generic type was used, export it using an alias.

```tsx
export { ComponentName } from './ComponentName'
export type { Props as ComponentNameProps } from './ComponentName'
```

### 4. Add the component export to the Component Group index file

The react component should be added to the list of exports in the Component Group directory index file. Only the react copmonent needs to be exported.

### 5. Create a mdx file

The component mdx file should have the same name as the react component with a .docs.mdx file extension. It should be added to the Component Group folder in docs/src/reference/mdx.

### 6. Create a snippets file

The component snippets file should have the same name as the react component with a .snippets.tsx and located in the Component Group folder in docs/src/reference/snippets.

### 7. Add the component to the module export test

Add the component to the module export test located at components/src/index.test.tsx.

## Scaffolding Components

A generator script is available that will perform items 1-6 of Adding Components. **Adding the component to the mododule export test must be done manually.** Access the script using:

```bash
yarn gen:component
```

## Style Guidelines

### Components

&middot; Use functional comnponents<br/>
&middot; Add displayName to forwardRefs

Prefer interface to type

### Styled Components

&middot; When using styled components prefix variables with $

### snippets

If snippet doesn't work, might need to turn it to string.

### Docs

Link to components from `@ensdomains/thorin`.

```
import { Field } from '@ensdomains/thorin'
```

## Adding Icons

Add a `.svg` file in pascal case to the `icons` folder and run:

```bash
yarn gen:icons
```

All files in the `icons` directory are automatically converted to React components and exported for use. Generated icons should follow a 24x24 bounding box.

## Test

```bash
yarn test
```

## Build

### Building the components

To build the comopnents in the components library use:

```bash
yarn build:components
```

### Building the project

```bash
yarn build
```

## Publishing New Versions

[Create a new release](https://github.com/ensdomains/thorin/releases/new) on GitHub with a tag that follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Publishing a release triggers a workflow for building, testing, and pushing to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ensdomains/thorin).

## FAQ

I update the component, why can't I see it in the docs?
you need to build:component before docs can see it.

Snippet isn't working
sometimes the component is not converted into string properly. Must turn code in snipets to string.

Says a framework is not available in Playroom
\export the component in docs/src/playroom/components.ts to make it available

Says a framework is not available in mdx code preview
add to scope property of LiveProvider component in docs/src/components/CodePreview/CodePreview.tsx

Props Table for types is weird
formatPropType in docs/src/components/PropsTable.tsx
