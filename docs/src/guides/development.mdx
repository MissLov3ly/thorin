## Set Up

Clone repository, install dependencies, and run docs site and Playroom.

```bash
yarn add @ensdomains/thorin
yarn
yarn dev
```

## Adding Components

Scaffold a new component:

```bash
yarn gen:component
```

The scaffolding script will prompt you to enter a component name in pascal case, if the component is a forwardRef, and which component group the component belongs in. Once successfully entered, the script will:

1\. Create a component file in the components folder.

2\. Create a component test file in the components folder.

3\. Create a component index file exporting the component and component interface.

4\. Create a mdx file in the docs folder.

5\. Create a snippets file in the docs folder.

6\. Add the component file to the component index files in the docs folder.

You will need to add the component to the test file at components/src/index.test.ts in order to pass the automated tests.

## Adding Icons

Add a `.svg` file in pascal case to the `icons` folder and run:

```bash
yarn gen:icons
```

All files in the `icons` directory are automatically converted to React components and exported for use. Generated icons should follow a 24x24 bounding box.

## Test

```bash
yarn test
```

## Build

```bash
yarn build
```

## Publishing New Versions

[Create a new release](https://github.com/ensdomains/thorin/releases/new) on GitHub with a tag that follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Publishing a release triggers a workflow for building, testing, and pushing to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ensdomains/thorin).
