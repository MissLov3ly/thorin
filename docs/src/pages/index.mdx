## Install

```bash
yarn add @ensdomains/thorin
```

## Set Up

Wrap the root of your app in a [`ThemeProvider`](https://styled-components.com/docs/advanced), import `ThorinGlobalStyles` and declare it as a child of `ThemeProvider` to set global styles. Alternatively, the `createGlobalStyle` module from `styled-components` can be use to replace the `ThorinGlobalStyles` if you prefer to customize your global styles. Set the theme by passing a theme object to `ThemeProvider`. If you do not want the ability to change themes, you can pass in a constant.

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components'
import { DefaultTheme, ThorinGlobalStyles } from '@ensdomains/thorin'

const App = () => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState<DefaultTheme>({ mode: 'light' })
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <ThorinGlobalStyles />
      {children}
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}
```

## Use Components

```tsx
import { Button, LockClosedSVG } from '@ensdomains/thorin'
```

```tsx live=true expand=true
<Stack alignItems="center">
  <div style={{ width: '180px' }}>
    <Button prefix={<LockClosedSVG />} variant="primary">
      Connect Wallet
    </Button>
  </div>
</Stack>
```

## Component Organization

Thorin is organized according to the [`Atomic Design Methodology`](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/).

**Atoms** serve as the foundational building blocks that comprise all our user interfaces. These atoms include basic HTML elements like form labels, inputs, buttons, and others that canâ€™t be broken down any further without ceasing to be functional.

**Molecules** are relatively simple groups of UI elements functioning together as a unit. For example, a form label, search input, and button can join together to create a search form molecule.

**Organisms** are relatively complex UI components composed of groups of molecules and/or atoms and/or other organisms. These organisms form distinct sections of an interface.

## Playroom

[Playroom](/playroom) is a zero-install code-oriented design environment, that allows you to test components simultaneously across a variety of themes and screen sizes.
